    "This section demonstrates advanced conda/pip usage, and is only for the more adventurous!\n",

    "A common way to manage your path in Python is to use the same method you might use to install other packages. Two common package managers are [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Conda is the package manager for the Anaconda distribution, so those of you who have downloaded Anaconda will already have conda installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is considered best practice to set up a Python [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for each type of project you are working on. A Python virtual environment is essentially a set of Python packages. When you have that environment activated, you have access to those packages, but no others. You might have different environments depending on the type project you are building. For example, a data science environment might have Pandas, Scikit-learn and similar packages installed in it, whereas a numerical modelling environment might have libraries that compile parts of the Python code, such as Numba. Ring-fencing these sets of packages in different environments guards against potential problems, such as conflicting package dependencies (e.g., if two packages themselves depend on different versions of the same package).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions here are for Conda, but similar instructions for Pip are [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), and then check out the \"editable\" option as described [here](https://pip-python3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#options).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a Conda environment by typing the following (as outlined in Conda's documentation on [managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name myenv package1 package2 ...\n",

    "```\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
