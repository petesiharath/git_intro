    "Try:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ls -l```\n",

    "### Moving around directories\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now think about navigating around the file system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by making a new directory called \"test\" (*I'm assuming you don't already have a directory called \"test\" here... if you do, either rename it, or use a different directory name in the following*):\n",
    "\n",
    "```mkdir test```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the ```mkdir``` command makes a new directory, in this case called \"test\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can navigate into that directory using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cd test```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```cd``` command stands for \"change directory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the two hidden \"files\" called \".\" and \"..\". These can be used with ```cd``` and other commands to get around the file system. Let's see how.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check you're in the \"test\" directory by using the ```pwd``` command, and then type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cd .```\n",
    "\n",
    "Type ```pwd``` again to see where you are. You'll see that you're still in the same directory! The period simply means \"this directory\", so we've used ```cd``` to change into the current directory. This may seem pretty pointless at the moment, but it'll quickly become clear why it's useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now try navigating to the double period:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cd ..```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you type ```pwd``` now, you should see that you've gone back up to the parent directory. So the \"..\" means \"go up one level\". With this command, we can now go up and down our directory tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: getting back home\n",
    "\n",
    "The tilde symbol \"~\" is a useful shortcut for your home directory. E.g., rather than having to go up each directory level one-by-one to get home, try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cd ~```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use this in file and folder names (e.g., ~/path/to/my/file/relative/to/home)"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```nano test.txt```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write some text, and then close the file using ^x, then \"Y\" and then Enter (see instructions at the bottom of the nano screen).\n",

    "There are lots of ways to view the contents of these files (e.g., check out ```less``` and ```more```). For now, let's just dump the contents to the screen using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cat test.txt```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ```cp``` command, let's make a copy of this file, and call it \"test1.txt\":\n",

    "\n",
    "List the contents of the directory and check that you can see both files.\n",

    "To move a file, we can use the ```mv``` command. Let's make a new folder and move one of our files into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mkdir subfolder```\n",
    "\n",
    "```mv test.txt subfolder/```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use ```ls``` to check that the file has been moved.\n",

    "\n",
    "```mv test1.txt test2.txt```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to delete a file, we can use the ```rm``` command. Let's delete the \"subfolder/test.txt\" file using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rm subfolder/test.txt```\n",

So you could do ```ls *.py``` to list only the files with the Python .py extension in a folder, or ```rm *.py``` to delete all the Python files. Use the asterisk wildcard to list only the file in the test directory with the character \"1\" in it.\n",
    "6. Create a directory called \"ex1\". Navigate into it, then use the copy command with the period symbol to copy the file ```ex1.txt``` into the directory.\n",
